WHY HARD CODED URLS ARE BAD?
	CHANGES REQUIRE CODE UPDATE.
	DYNAMIC URLS IN THE CLOUD
	LOAD BALANCING
	MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTS
	
1. CLIENT SIDE SERVICE DISCOVERY
	CLIENT > DISCOVERY SERVER > CLIENT > SERVICES
2. SERVER SIDE SERVICE DISCOVERY
	CLIENT > DISCOVERY SERVER > SERVICES
	
SPRING CLOUD USES CLIENT SIDE DISCOVERY
	
	EUREKA
	NETFLIX OSS LEADER IN MICROSERVICES
	
	START EUREKA SERVER
	HAVE MS REGISTER USING EUREKA CLIENT
	HAVE MS LOCATE EUREKA CLIENT
	
	FAULT TOLERANCE WORKS?
	SEND "HEART BEATS"
	
	WHAT IF THE DISCOVERY SERVER GOES DOWN?
	CACHE WILL COME IN TO PICTURE
	BECAUSE OF @LOADBALANCER 
	
	LEVEL 2
	
	AGENDA
		1. UNDERSTAND CHALLENGES WITH AVAILABILITY
		2. MAKING MICROSERVICES RESILIENT AND FAULT TOLERANT
	
	WHAT IS FAULT TOLEANCE AND RESILIENCE?
		
	ISSUES WITH MICROSERVICES
		1. AN INSTANCE GOES DOWN SOLUTION: CREATE MULTIPLE INSTANCES
		2. RIBBON: ROUND ROBBIN!!!!
		3. AN INSTANCE IS SLOW - BIGGER PROBLEM - WAITING THREADS - RESOURCES WILL BE EXAUSTED 
		4. SOLUTION: TIMEOUTS   
	TIMEOUT ON REST TEMPLATE: ANY SERVICES WHICH CALLS ANOTHER SERVICE
	
	CIRCUIT BREAKER PATTERN
		DETECT SOMETHING IS WRONG
		TAKE TEMP STEPS TO AVOID THE SITUATION GETTING WORSE
		DEACTIVATE THE PROBLEM COMPONENT SO THAT IT DOESNT AFFECT DOWNSTREAM COMPONENTS
	
	CAN APPLY CIRCUIT BREAKER TO ALL THE SERVICES WHICH IS CALLING OTHER SERVICE
		IT IS IMPORTANT WHEN A MS IS CALLING TWO OR MORE MS's
		
	CIRCUIT BREAKER PARAMS
		LAST N REQUESTS TO CONSIDER FOR THE DECISION
		HOW MANY OF THOSE SHOULD FAIL
		TIMEOUT DURATION
	WHEN DOES THE CIRCUIT UN-TRIP
		HOW LONG AFTER A CIRCUIT TRIP TO TRY AGAIN?
